# **Classic Snake Game**

Classic Snake Game is an enjoyable and engaging game developed in Unity. In the game, you control a green snake that gets longer as it eats randomly spawned apples. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible without eating your own body. Unique to this game, the snake gets teleported to the opposite wall instead of dying upon hitting the wall, making the only way to lose by eating yourself.
